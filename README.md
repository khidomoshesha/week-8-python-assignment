# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project analyzes global COVID-19 trends using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).  
It focuses on case numbers, deaths, and vaccination rates across countries, with a specific look at Kenya, the United States, and India.

## Project Objectives

- Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- Compare metrics across countries
- Visualize trends using charts and heatmaps
- Summarize findings and key insights

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the dataset `owid-covid-data.csv` from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-data).
2. Save the dataset in the same folder as the script or notebook.
3. Open the Python script (`.py`) or Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).
4. Run all cells or execute the script to generate visualizations and insights.

## Visualizations Included

- Line charts: Total cases and deaths over time
- Bar chart: Top 10 countries by total cases (latest date)
- Correlation heatmap: Cases, deaths, and vaccination relationships

## Insights & Summary

- The United States leads in both total cases and deaths.
- India's average death rate is lower compared to Kenya and the United States.
- Vaccination uptake and population coverage vary widely.
- Strong correlations exist between total cases and deaths, and between vaccinations and new case trends.
